TODO:

    Code taste:
        how similar to linq should it be?
            what ways can gdscript be uniquely leveraged/advantaged
		generally move towards objects as opposed to raw dictionaries
			wrap dictionary in default class
			think mongo db c# (BSON)

    improvements/planned features:
        add functions:
			any() -> bool,
			all() -> bool,
            add(_if), remove(_if)

		# online after this + some clean-up
                
        select, where with func
            i.e. lambda

		search keys and values??

		built in support for unique-id system

		json
			+save support - not sure this is necessary

		better examples showing all major features

		monitoring/signals
			observer pattern

		some method for accessing nested fields
			In builder method?:
				Start().First(cmps).Open("inventory").First({type=eq("sword")})

		actions:
			for_each,
			mathematical functions
				Add, Sub, Mult, Div, Mod
			Append/Erase on signal/event?
