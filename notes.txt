TODO:

    Code taste:
        how similar to linq should it be?
            what ways can gdscript be uniquely leveraged/advantaged
		generally move towards objects as opposed to raw dictionaries
			wrap dictionary in default class
			think mongo db c# (BSON)

		library modules
		
		db class vs IterList of Lists
			add collection vs IterList.first({name=collection_name})

    improvements/planned features:
		show take in example
		
        add functions (chainers and functional):
			any() -> bool,
			all() -> bool,
            add(_if), remove(_if)
			at(index)
			size, first, last

		remove any need to access iter_list.items
			RF in shopkeeper example

		# online after this + some clean-up, readme
		
        select, where with func
            i.e. lambda
				able to read key and value
				var age_comp = GLF.and_([GLF.gt(20), GLF.lt(100)])
				var cash_comp = GLF.gt(1200)
				var chain = Builders.ChainerKV.start()\
					.where(and([{age=age_comp}, {cash=cash_comp}]))
					.where(or([{age=age_comp}, {cash=cash_comp}]))


		for_each(action)

		built in support for unique-id system

		functions
			change:
				append, remove -> return copy of original
				combine/union?
			generation (a la numpy):
				repeat(i) -> list of i repeated N times
			mathematical:
				sum, average, min, max

		search keys and values??

		json
			+ write support - not sure this is necessary

		better examples showing all major features

		monitoring/signals
			observer pattern
			on_destroy/create

		some method for accessing nested fields
			In builder method?:
				Start().First(cmps).Open("inventory").First({type=eq("sword")})


		actions (on data):
		for_each
			mathematical functions
				Add, Sub, Mult, Div, Mod
			Append/Erase on signal/event?


	test library - gut??

	ecs impl example
		requires id system
		
Shopkeeper example
	use builder method to avoid duplicate comparisons

	how to handle multiplication of values by price
		for_each??
		pass edited list to gui for display

	show item stats
		in hover/tooltip
		or use center panel

	refactor gui code
		set nodes in gui scene, get using variable
		set player name from exported var
		
	UI:
		;::;
		®∫®¬g
		o/
		
	dialogue: (? separate example ?)
		search wares, gossip
